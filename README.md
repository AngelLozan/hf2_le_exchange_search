# HF2 LE Exchange Search

A little automation for the Hack Force II team.

## Basic info and Scope
- Search by address can be done via API but I believe the currency has to be included as well in order to return the results. 
- You can't define a time range via API, it'll just give you all that matches. 
- It has to include the fromAsset or the toAsset. 
- We donâ€™t always receive the asset with the address. This will effect searching for EVM and TRX addresses. Weâ€™ll get all assets that match the address (ETH, BNB, TRX, USDT). 

- Match `TO ADDRESS` to `TO CURRENCY` & `FROM ADDRESS` to `FROM CURRENCY`

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Before installing, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 22.0.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (installed automatically via `devDependencies`)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started


### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hf2_law_enforcement_search.git
cd hf2_law_enforcement_search
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
tsc
```


### 4. Usage:

- Order of arguments is important. If you have one argument and not the other separating two, then use a space and an empty string `''`
- Structure the CSV, if path passed, to have one header value named `Address` under which all addresses you wish to check are located. *`Address` is case sensitive*
  
- You do not need to include the asset on the csv, just one column, the `Address`. Assets are determined initially, where unavailable from the API call, in the `./src/cryptoregex.ts`. 

ex: 

```csv
Address
0x.......
TR.....
bc1......

```


Full implementation with all parameters possible in the designated order:

```zsh
npm run search '<path_to_csv_of_addresses>' '<fromAddress>' '<toAddress>' '<toCurrency>' '<fromCurrency>'
```


Search based on CSV of addresses:

```zsh
npm run search '<path_to_csv_of_addresses>'
```

Example where you have no CSV but you have a `fromAddress` and nothing else (ie. the other parameters will be `null`):

```zsh
npm run search '' '<fromAddress>' 
```


With only single addresses and currencies:

```zsh
npm run search '' '<fromAddress>' '<toAddress>' '<toCurrency>' '<fromCurrency>'
```



### 5. Contributions & Maintenance:
